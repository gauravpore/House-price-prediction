# üìå Real-Estate-price-prediction 
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Introduction
Creating a Machine Learning model to predict the real estate prices. We are going to use the dataset from **Kaggle.com**.

>Concept Used in this project:
* Linear Regression

>Tools and Technology used:
* Python
* Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
* Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
* sklearn for model building

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps
```Python
#Step1: Importing the required libraries
#Step2: Load Data
#Step3: Understanding Data
       - drop unnecessary columns
#Step4: Data Cleaning
       - check nan values
       - verify unique values
       - extract rows and columns
#Step5: Visualizing Data
       - visualizing relationship between X-axes and Y-axes
#Step6: Build Machine Learning Model
#Step7: Testing Results
#Step8: Evaluating Model using R-Square
#Step9: Plotting Final Graph on Actual vs Predicted results
```
